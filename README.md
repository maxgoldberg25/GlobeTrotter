- **Interactive Map**: View all shared photos on a global map with location markers
- **Profile Management**: Customize your profile and view other users' galleries
- **Location Tracking**: Automatically capture or manually set photo locations
- **Social Features**: Follow other travelers and interact with their content

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Map Integration**: Leaflet with React-Leaflet
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## AI Location Detection

GlobeTrotter now features experimental AI-powered location detection for photos. This feature helps users identify where their photos were taken when they're unsure of the location.

### How It Works

1. **Upload a Photo**: In the photo upload form, select an image from your device
2. **AI Detection**: If you don't know where the photo was taken, click "Use AI to Detect Location"
3. **Review Results**: The AI will analyze landmarks and visual features to guess the location
4. **Verify on Map**: Once detected, the location will be displayed on the map for confirmation
5. **Edit if Needed**: You can still manually adjust the location if the AI prediction isn't accurate

### Technical Implementation

- Powered by Picarta AI's image recognition technology
- Uses landmark recognition and geographical feature analysis
- Results include latitude, longitude, and location name when available
- The experimental feature has varying accuracy depending on recognizable landmarks

### Privacy Note

- All image processing is done securely
- Photos are not stored by the AI service
- Users retain full control over which photos to analyze
- Location data is only saved when the user confirms the upload

> **Note**: This is an experimental feature and may not accurately identify all locations. Results work best for photos with recognizable landmarks or distinctive geographical features.
