## AI Location Detection Feature

The application now includes an experimental AI-powered location detection feature using the Picarta API. This feature can automatically analyze photos and suggest potential location coordinates based on landmarks and visual features in the image.

### Requirements

- **Image Format**: Only JPEG images are supported for AI location detection
- **API Key**: Requires a valid Picarta API key set in the environment variables
- **Image Quality**: Best results achieved with clear, outdoor photos containing recognizable landmarks

### How to Use

1. Upload a JPEG image or provide an image URL in the photo upload form
2. Click the "Use AI to Detect Location" button in the yellow information box
3. The AI will analyze the image and attempt to determine the location
4. If successful, the map will automatically update with the detected coordinates
5. You can verify and adjust the detected location on the map if needed

### Environment Setup

To use this feature, you must set the following environment variable:

## Recent Bug Fixes

### Map Location Selection

We've resolved an issue where manually selecting a location on the map wasn't properly recognized during form submission. The fix addresses:

- Correctly handling zero-value coordinates (like longitude 0Â° at Greenwich)
- Ensuring manual map selections take precedence over AI detection
- Preventing the "Please select a location on the map" error when coordinates are already set

### Image Size Optimization

The application now automatically optimizes images to prevent payload size issues:

- Large images are automatically resized before uploading to the server
- Images for AI location detection are compressed to ensure compatibility with API limits
- Original image quality is preserved for viewing while optimizing for server requirements

These fixes improve reliability when uploading photos with both manual map selections and AI-detected locations.
